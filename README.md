This repository is a collection of my solutions to the programming exercises and programming projects in the textbook <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Liang-Introduction-to-Java-Programming-and-Data-Structures-Comprehensive-Version-11th-Edition/9780134670942.html"><strong>Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures Comprehensive Version Eleventh Edition written by Y. Daniel Liang</strong></a>. The programming exercises and projects contain problems involving object oriented programming, data structures, recursion, lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps and developing efficient algorithms. I would appreciate any feedback involving my personal solutions to these problems and would be happy to answer any questions!
