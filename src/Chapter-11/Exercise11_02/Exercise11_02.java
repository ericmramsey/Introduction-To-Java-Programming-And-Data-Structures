/*
    (The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a
    class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
    Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name,
    address, phone number, and email address. A student has a class status (freshman,
    sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An employee has
    an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming
    Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired. A faculty member has office
    hours and a rank. A staff member has a title. Override the toString method in
    each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
    Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test program
    that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and
    invokes their toString() methods.
